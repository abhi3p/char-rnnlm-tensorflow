# Char RNN Language Model based on Tensorflow
Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for character-level language models in Python using Tensorflow.

If you are not familar with RNN, you can first read my post <https://github.com/pangolulu/rnn-from-scratch>.

Inspired from Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

See his article [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) to learn more about this model.

## How to use?
In the directory `scripts`, you can first run `sh shakespeare.sh` to train the model, and the run `sh sample.sh` to sample text based on the model.
